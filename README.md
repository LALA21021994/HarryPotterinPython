# HarryPotterinPython
A project aiming to translate the story of the first Harry Potter into a program run in Python 

The challenge is to see how we are able to translate a litteral work by an actual author into a program summing up with as much details the interactions between characters, places and actions. The challenge here is to build the code chronologically meaning that like the book we want to follow that same time-flow. 

This is a student project and we would welcome any contributions and collaborations with great pleasure.
